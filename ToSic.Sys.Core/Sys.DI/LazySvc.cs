/// Helps us create lazy **Service** objects. It has some special features:

/// * It will automatically lazy-attach a logger when used correctly
/// * It can also be configured with a lazy init function to keep code clean.
/// 
/// This reduces the amount of plumbing in many code files.
///
/// It will detect if the provided object/service supports these features.
/// So if it's used for anything that doesn't support logging it will just behave like `Lazy`.
